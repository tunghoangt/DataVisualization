# DataVisualization
### CUNY Data Visualization Fall 2019
#### Authors: Md Ayub Ali Sarker, Tony Hoang, Carlos Martinez, Thomas Duffy

We built a dynamic site to visualize fishery data going back to 1960 within the
United States. This visualization allows aggregations by dollars and pounds over
a specific year within the range.

The React app along with the data is contained within `app`. The source data
along with the script used to clean it is in `app/src/data`. All other artifacts
are related to the React app.

If you would like to run and view the project locally, after cloning simply run:
```shell
cd app
yarn
yarn start
```

and it should be hosted at `localhost:3000` by yarn on your machine.
